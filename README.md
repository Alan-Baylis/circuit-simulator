- [ ] Vagrant provisioning for dev environment
- [ ] Make React components to draw simple circuit elements
- [ ] Build and distribute a library so other projects can import Circuit Diagram
- [ ] Ability for client apps to easily interact with the library to e.g. add/remove components, model voltages/currents

## Dependencies

- Node.js/io.js
- [Flow](http://flowtype.org/)
- For node-gyp:
  + Python 2.7, `make`, and a C/C++ compile e.g. GCC
