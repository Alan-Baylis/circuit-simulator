Circuit Diagram
===============

A view layer for drawing interactive circuit diagrams.

## TODO

- [ ] Make React components to draw simple circuit elements
- [ ] Build and distribute a library so other projects can import Circuit Diagram
- [ ] Ability for client apps to easily interact with the library to e.g. add/remove components, model voltages/currents

## Dependencies

- Node.js/io.js
- Flow (in future when it supports ES6 modules - see facebook/flow#62)
- For node-gyp:
  + Python 2.7, `make`, and a C/C++ compile e.g. GCC

TODO: Vagrant provisioning

Made using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [React ART](https://github.com/reactjs/react-art) and [RefluxJS](https://github.com/spoike/refluxjs).
